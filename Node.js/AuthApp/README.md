# AuthApp - Sample Node.js integration app

AuthApp is a simple Node.js application that represents how a simple web application should integrate with Sesamy Authentication platform.
# How to integrate?

- Contact us to receive a set of credentials for your application
- Call an API to get the authentication payload and the QR code for it
- Render the QR code on your login page
- Listen for the login authorization event on your client side
- Submit your login form to your server
- Pass the authentication payload to the authenticare API and get the user information
- Implement the user mapping logic on your server side and authenticate on behalf of the mapped user. 

# Sample code

We try to add sample applications for the supported platforms. We currently have a simple Node.js application that shows how a Node.js application should integrate with Sesamy platform.
